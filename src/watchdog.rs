//! Independent Watchdog (IWDG) driver for boot safety.
//!
//! The IWDG runs from the LSI oscillator (~32 kHz) and is independent of the
//! main system clock.  Once started it **cannot be stopped** — this is by
//! design and ensures that a stuck firmware will always reset.
//!
//! Usage:
//! 1. Call [`start`] early in `init`, **before** `confirm_boot()`.
//! 2. Call [`feed`] periodically in the main loop (must be called at least
//!    once per timeout period).
//!
//! If the new firmware never calls `confirm_boot` or hangs, the watchdog
//! fires a reset.  The bootloader sees `SWAP_COMPLETE` (app didn't confirm)
//! and reverts to the previous firmware.
